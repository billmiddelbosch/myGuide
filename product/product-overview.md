# cityCast

## Description
cityCast is a clean, easy-to-use webapp that lets travelers create personalized audio tours tailored to their available time and interests. Using AI-generated narration and smart route planning, users can explore any city on their own terms - at a fraction of the cost of traditional guided tours.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Existing tours aren't personal
cityCast lets you build a tour around your interests and curiosities, not a generic script.

### Problem 2: Audio tours are too expensive
Affordable pricing makes personalized audio tours accessible to every traveler.

### Problem 3: Pre-set tours don't fit your schedule
Time-based planning ensures your tour fits the hours you actually have available.

### Problem 4: No organic discovery channel
Dynamic, SEO-optimized address pages create thousands of unique, indexable landing pages targeting specific address searches to capture organic traffic.

### Problem 5: Cold traffic has no context
Address landing pages show rich neighborhood info — street descriptions, city highlights, nearby attractions — that builds trust and interest before routing visitors to the tour experience.

### Problem 6: Visitors can't plan around the weather
Tour stop pages show a live weather widget (current conditions + multi-day forecast) powered by the Open-Meteo API, based on the stop's coordinates — helping users decide when to go or what to bring.

### Problem 7: Map previews feel heavy or limited on stop pages
A static map loads instantly on each stop page with a clear expand button to open the full interactive map — balancing performance with usability.
